# SDd

This repository contains the implementation of SDd, a dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DSSE) scheme proposed in [1]. SDd achieves forward and Type-II backward privacy [2], and it is one of the most efficient DSSE schemes with minimised storage cost on the client. Since this scheme is not implemented with a RPC framework, we integrate Apache Thrift with this scheme to evaluate its performance under the networked environment and compare it with the real network performance of a new DSSE scheme (Aura) proposed in our NDSS'21 paper [3].



## Requirements

* Git
* Ubuntu 18.04
* g++-7 (7.5.0 in ubuntu 18.04)
* cmake 3.17
* openssl 1.1.1
* Apache Thrift 0.13.0



## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shangqimonash/SDd.git
cd SDd
mkdir build
cd build
# use cmake/make to build the code
cmake ..
make
```



## Usage

After compiling the project, three executable files of SDd will be generated. The first one is `SSETest`, which runs SDd client and server operations as a local procedure. This can be used to evaluate the performance of Aura with no communication cost. The other two files (`SDdServer` and `SDdClient`)  can be used to execute Aura in a networked environment. Particularly, the `SDdServer` starts an Apache Thrift server which can process the setup, update, query operations from the `SDdClient`. The results from these two executable file reflect the performance of Aura in real-world networks.

All the above executable files can be executed without extra parameters.
